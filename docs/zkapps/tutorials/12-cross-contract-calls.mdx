# Tutorial 12: Cross Contract Calls

In this tutorial, you learn how smart contracts on a blockchain can interact by calling functions in each other's code, enabling building modular and complex decentralized applications.

Cross contract calls allow smart contracts on a blockchain to interact with each other. This enables building complex decentralized applications (dApps) from multiple modular components. In a cross contract call, a function in one smart contract can call a function in another smart contract to leverage existing code and functionality.

In this tutorial you will learn about passing data between contracts, handling events and return values when contracts call each other. 

The full example code is provided in the [12-cross-contract-calls/src/](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/zkapps/12-cross-contract-calls/src) example files.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the latest version of the zkApp CLI installed:

    ```sh
    $ npm install -g zkapp-cli
    ```

- Ensure your environment meets the [Prerequisites](/zkapps/tutorials#prerequisites) for zkApp Developer Tutorials.

This tutorial has been tested with:

- [Mina zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli) version `0.16.0`
- [o1js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/o1js) version `0.16.2`

## Create a new project

Now that you have the tooling installed, you can start building your application.

1. Create or change to a directory where you have write privileges.
1. Now, create a project using the `zk project` command:

    ```sh
    $ zk project 12-cross-contract-calls
    ```
    
    As you learned in earlier tutorials, the `zk project` command creates the `12-cross-contract-calls` directory that contains the scaffolding for your project.

1. Change into the `12-cross-contract-calls` directory. 

Like all projects, you run `zk` commands from the root of the `12-cross-contract-calls` directory as you work in the `src` directory on files that contain the TypeScript code for the smart contract. 

Each time you make updates, then build or deploy, the TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript in the `build` directory.

### Prepare the project

Like earlier tutorials, you can prepare your project by deleting the default files that come with the new project and creating a smart contract called `Composability`.

Open `src/index.ts` in a text editor and import the `Add` smart contract, like:
	
	```ts src/index.ts
	import { Composability } from './Composability.js';
	
	export { Composability };

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to implement cross contract calls, allowing smart contracts to interact and unlocking new possibilities for modular blockchain applications.
